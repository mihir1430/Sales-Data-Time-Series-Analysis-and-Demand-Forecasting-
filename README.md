# Superstore Sales Time Series Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Superstore sales data using Time Series Analysis techniques to forecast future sales. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can help in demand forecasting and business planning.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of historical sales data from a Superstore, including:
- **Date**: The timestamp of sales records
- **Sales**: The total sales revenue per day
- **Other Features**: Additional columns that may impact sales trends

## Technologies & Libraries Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
  - Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
  - Time Series Analysis: Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
  - Machine Learning Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras)
  - Other Utilities: MinMaxScaler, OpenCV (if applicable)

## Project Workflow
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, data transformation)
- Visualizing sales trends over time
- Checking for seasonality, trends, and cyclic patterns

### 2. Time Series Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Checking stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
- Applying transformations (differencing, log transformations) if required

### 3. Model Implementation
- **Traditional Models**
  - ARIMA: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
  - SARIMA: Seasonal ARIMA for handling seasonality
- **Deep Learning Model**
  - LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory model for time series forecasting

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Performance Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE
- Comparing different forecasting models

### 5. Forecasting Future Sales
- Using the best-performing model to predict sales for the next 7 days

## Installation & Setup
To run this project locally, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_link>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd superstore-time-series
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook superstore-sale-time-series-analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Results & Insights
- Identified trends and seasonality in sales data.
- Evaluated multiple forecasting models.
- SARIMA and LSTM provided the best forecasting accuracy.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate external factors such as holidays, promotions, and economic indicators.
- Deploy the best model using a Flask/FastAPI-based API.
- Implement real-time sales forecasting using a live dashboard.
